# PotterHead-website

**Welcome to the Wizarding World! 🧙‍♂️🪄**

This project is a magical experience designed especially for Harry Potter fans! Step into a world of enchantment through this interactive website where you can:

- **Chat with the Sorting Hat** to discover which Hogwarts house you truly belong to  
- **Explore the Marauder’s Map** (magical version, of course!)  
- **Use spells instead of buttons**, with interactive 3D models of your favorite magical characters  

The project is currently a **work in progress**, and I'll be pushing updates regularly as new features are developed. Once it's complete, it will be deployed for everyone to enjoy the full magical experience.

**Stay tuned, witches and wizards! ⚡**
A whisper of magic awaits on the first page... 😉
